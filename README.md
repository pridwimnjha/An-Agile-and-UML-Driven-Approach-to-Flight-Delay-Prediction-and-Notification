# ✈️ Flight Delay Detection and Notification System

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation and research work for our paper:
**“An Agile and UML-Driven Approach to Flight Delay Prediction and Notification”**

The project focuses on designing and implementing a **Flight Delay Detection and Notification System** using **Object-Oriented Design Principles**, **UML diagrams**, and the **Agile Scrum methodology**.

The system predicts potential flight delays using **machine learning models** and disseminates **real-time notifications** to passengers, airline staff, and administrators—thereby improving operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Flight Delay Prediction** using machine learning models
* **Notification System** for passengers, airline staff, and admins
* **Agile Scrum Methodology** for iterative development
* **UML-Based System Design** (Class, Activity, Sequence, Use Case, and State Diagrams)
* **Real-Time Dashboards** for flight status and performance monitoring

---

## 📂 System Architecture

The project follows **object-oriented principles** and includes:

* `User` classes (Passenger, Admin, Airline Staff)
* `Flight` and `WeatherData` modules for operational data
* `DelayPredictionSystem` powered by ML models
* `NotificationSystem` for real-time alerts
* `ReportGenerator` for admins

---

## 📊 UML Diagrams

The system is modeled using:

* **Scrum Workflow**
* **Class Diagram**
* **Activity Diagram** (Flight Booking & Check-in)
* **Sequence Diagrams** (Booking, Delay Prediction, Notifications)
* **Use Case Diagram** (Stakeholder Interactions)
* **State Diagram** (Flight Status Transitions)

*(Diagrams included in `/diagrams` folder)*

## ⚙️ Methodology

* Adopted **Agile Scrum Framework**

  * Product Backlog creation
  * Sprint Planning & Execution
  * Daily Stand-ups & Retrospectives
* Developed system incrementally with continuous feedback
* Evaluated against **Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral models** → Scrum proved most effective

---

## 🚀 Results

* Accurate **real-time flight delay detection** using machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
* Automated **notification alerts** to passengers and staff
* **Interactive dashboards** for monitoring
* Improved **airline operational efficiency** and **passenger satisfaction**

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Scalability improvements via **containerization and load balancing**
* Integration with **air traffic control feeds & maintenance logs**
* **Continuous learning models** for better accuracy
* **Multilingual support** and **personalized notification settings**
